## Structure of tutorial

- Review of making effective plots using ggplot2's grammar of graphics:
    - Organising your data to enable mapping variables to graphical elements, 
    - Common plot descriptions as scripts,
    - Do's and don'ts following cognitive perception principles.
- Making decisions and inferential statements based on data plots
    - What is your plot testing? Determining the hypothesis based on the type of plot.
    - Creating null samples to build lineups for comparison and testing.
    - Conducting a lineup test using your friends to determine whether what you see is real or spurious, and to determine the best design for your plot.

Background: Participants should have a good working knowledge of R, and tidy verse, and some experience with ggplot2. Familiarity with the material in R4DS (https://r4ds.hadley.nz) is helpful.

## Getting started

1. You should have a reasonably up to date version of R and R Studio, eg RStudio RStudio 2023.06.2 +561 and R version 4.3.1 (2023-06-16). 
```
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "tidyr", "dplyr", "readr", "nullabor", "colorspace", "palmerpenguins", "broom"))
```

2. Download the [Zip file of materials]() to your laptop, and unzip it. 

3. Open your RStudio be clicking on `tutorial.Rproj`. 

There might be a few more packages to install to run various parts.
